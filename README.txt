PROJECT STRATEGIES

1. Flow chart. One of the biggest challenges in this project is to have clear
definitions of the behaviors of the system, since the project specifications are
leaning towards the ambiguous side. A very important tool our team adopted to
overcome this challenge is to use flow chart to figure out the workflow of the
target system. In the inception phase of the project, our team of two would sit
down in front of a white board, and started brainstorming the workflow of the
system, and then put the workflow into flow chart to make sure every path
through the chart is defined in the project specifications.

2. Pair programming. The amount of code needs writing in this project is
honestly not that much. But the challenge is that our team have only learned Ada
for a couple of weeks, and the language itself is drastically different from a
lot of popular imperative programming languages we were familiar with in terms
of its syntax and features. So it was really easy to make beginner's mistakes
that we would not make otherwise with other languages in the development
process. Therefore, we decided pair programming would be a good strategy to
limit the chance of making those mistakes. However, it indeed slowed down the
development to some extent.

3. Unit testing. Of course, to make sure the program's correctness, we also
adopted some of the techniques we learned from SWEN90006 for unit testing.
Mainly, input partitioning and boundary value analysis.
